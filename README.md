# JavaScript-With-Noraiz
I'm documenting my JavaScript learning journey here, inspired by CodeWithHarry's tutorials. This repository holds my daily practice codes, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome!
# JavaScript Practice 🚀  

This repository contains my daily JavaScript practice codes while learning from *CodeWithHarry* on YouTube. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript concepts by solving exercises, building small programs, and experimenting with different features of the language.
